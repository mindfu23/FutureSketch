# FutureSketch
Repo for scripts to control the LEDs for my interactive sculpture Future Sketch.

--2025-06-29--

All files starting with "Beaglebones_pixlite" are v1 test scripts, set 1. The one titled "_total.py" has the most options and some comments.

Notes:
- may need to find the Beaglebones IP address again. Enter arp -a before I connect it, and then afterwards.
- curent functionality includes a slow fade. Acceleromater shaking / erasing is currently post-MVP
